A deadlocked program is the one in which all the concurrent processes are waiting on on another.
Starvation is any situation where a concurrent process cannot get all the resources it needs to perform work.
One can easily verify whether a deadlock can arise based on Coffman Conditions which can help to detect, prevent, and correct deadlocks.
