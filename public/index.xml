        <description>Epilogue In the world of concurrency, deadlock and starvation are pretty famous.
A deadlocked program is the one in which all the concurrent processes are waiting on on another.
Starvation is any situation where a concurrent process cannot get all the resources it needs to perform work.
One can easily verify whether a deadlock can arise based on Coffman Conditions which can help to detect, prevent, and correct deadlocks.
Mutual exclusion Wait for condition No premption Circular wait Broadly speaking starvation is a scenario where one or more greedy concurrent process is unfairly preventing some one or more concurrent processes from completing a task.</description>

        <description>Core Principles 1. Plain Text is Encoding-Dependent Text is not inherently “plain”; it is a sequence of bytes. The meaning of those bytes depends on the character encoding used. Assuming ASCII is universal is incorrect and unsafe. 2. Legacy Encoding Problems ASCII (7-bit) supported only basic English characters. Extended ranges (128–255) were reused differently in regional code pages (OEM, ANSI, etc.). Result: the same byte value could map to different characters depending on locale.</description>
