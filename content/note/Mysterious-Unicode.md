## Core Principles

### 1. Plain Text is Encoding-Dependent
- Text is not inherently “plain”; it is a sequence of bytes.  
- The meaning of those bytes depends on the **character encoding** used.  
- Assuming ASCII is universal is incorrect and unsafe.  

### 2. Legacy Encoding Problems
- **ASCII (7-bit)** supported only basic English characters.  
- Extended ranges (128–255) were reused differently in regional **code pages** (OEM, ANSI, etc.).  
- Result: the same byte value could map to different characters depending on locale.  
- This created major incompatibilities across systems.  

### 3. Network and Internationalization Issues
- With the rise of the Internet, email, and multilingual software, encoding mismatches became visible.  
- Common failure case: **mojibake** (garbled characters) when data encoded in one system was misinterpreted by another.  

### 4. Unicode Fundamentals
- Unicode defines a **unique code point** for every character across all writing systems.  
- Clarification: Unicode is **not** limited to 16 bits. It supports more than 65,536 characters.  
- Multiple **encodings of Unicode** exist (e.g., UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32), each optimized for different trade-offs.  

### 5. Developer Requirements
- Every software developer must understand the relationship between:  
  - **Characters** (abstract symbols)  
  - **Code points** (numeric identifiers in Unicode)  
  - **Encodings** (rules for representing code points as bytes)  
- Misunderstanding or ignoring this leads to data corruption and software bugs.  

### 6. Complexity vs. Minimum Competence
- Full internationalization/localization is complex.  
- However, understanding **encodings and Unicode basics** is a non-optional prerequisite for modern software development.

## Why This Knowledge Remains Critical
- **Global software systems** cannot rely on single-byte encodings.  
- **Interoperability** requires proper handling of Unicode.  
- **Backward compatibility** with legacy encodings remains a challenge.

## Recap Table

| Concept                  | Key Technical Point                                              |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Plain Text                | Bytes are meaningless without defined encoding                  |
| ASCII & Code Pages        | Inconsistent mappings caused cross-system corruption            |
| Internet Impact           | Encoding errors became widespread with email and global systems |
| Unicode                   | Unified system: one code point per character across languages   |
| Encodings (UTF-8, etc.)   | Different methods of mapping Unicode code points to bytes       |
| Developer Responsibility  | Must understand encodings to avoid data loss/corruption         |
